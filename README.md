### Hi! My name is Grayson!
Biophysicist and computational biochemist.  Background in systems and optical engineering for bioimaging applications.  These days I'm a full-time protein scientist.  I love finding out how proteins work on every level, from mechanism to allostery to assembly.  I also help develop several tools for the analysis of MD trajectories.

- B.S. Biomedical Engineering, 2020, *Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute*
- Ph.D. Quantitative Biosciences and Engineering, 2025, *Colorado School of Mines*
